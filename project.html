    <h1>COSC1708 Assignment 1 (My IT profile)</h1>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Hi. I am Nafisa Rahman, born and brought up in Bangladesh and recently moved to Australia a few weeks ago. I completed my high school back in 2020 and then decided to study in Australia. Ever since I remember, we had a family tradition of travelling to a new place every 1-2 years which really grew my appreciation for various languages and different cultures. That’s where my love for picking up new languages came from as I always wanted to be a polyglot. I currently speak 4 languages (Bengali, Hindi, English, Japanese) and hope to add more to my list in the future. My South Asian heritage also meant we were always a household that was deeply appreciative of dance and various forms of music, which is why I naturally enjoy them as well. As for my other interests, its highly ambiguous as I delve into a lot of new things and hobbies at once, but my brain doesn’t allow me to stick to a particular one for a long time.</p>
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>The side of IT that I am most interested in would be User experience designing and Web development, as they are connected to one another. I would be more than happy to work on either. Whenever I am visiting a site or using an app, I immediately dismiss it and stop using it altogether if the design isn’t easy on the eye or if it isn’t comfortable to use. Regardless of how innovative or informative the app or website is, I am sure many people switch to different sites due to the same reasons like I do. It always made me wonder if I was the one in the driver’s seat, what touches I would put to negate this negative response from myself.</p>
    <p> In my first year at Melbourne University, I did a subject that required us to design wire frames for a game and later create a prototype for it before moving to the actual programming part. I realized I enjoyed that more than any of my subjects I was doing at that time. I was initially doing computer science but after this I was set on doing IT as it was more relevant towards what I was interested in. But unfortunately, they did not offer a bachelor’s degree for information technology. I did not wait any further and decided to transfer to RMIT as they are known to have a great student experience for IT and computer science departments. Throughout my time here I hope to learn skills that would help me with my future job prospects and help me grow as a person.</p>
    <h2>Personal profile</h2>
    <h3>MBTI</h3>
    <p>I fall under the Campaigners (ENFPs) who are known as the true free spirits. As I my MBTI says I am devoted to enriching my relationships and my social lives, I believe it would work in my favor to develop an amicable dynamic with people when working in a group setting. Some of my personality traits also exhibit me being perceptive and an excellent communicator. These traits will benefit me when trying to articulate problems or progress when working with people. But I also tend to be disorganized and restless which I have always known to be. These tend to affect me when I am trying to meet deadlines.</p>
    <h3>Learning style</h3>
    <p>I am mostly a visual learner as shown by my result, vision being at 40% followed by auditory at 35% and tactile at 25%. I tend to learn by reading or seeing pictures. I also mostly understand and remember things by sight. Furthermore, I have difficulty with spoken directions and I am easily distracted by sounds.</p>
    <h3>Big Five Personality</h3>
    <p>My Factor I was labelled as Extroversion. Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality. My Factor II is labeled as Emotional Stability. Along with that my Factor III is labeled as Agreeableness. A person that is high in agreeableness is said to be friendly and optimistic. My Factor IV is labeled as Conscientiousness followed by my Factor V which is Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience.</p>
    <p>While I do agree with most of the test results, I do not think they are the perfect representation of myself. I believe my extroversion can help me greatly when I am working in a group setting and help me articulate myself better. I am a visual learner and I also do believe I work great when I am in a creative scope. I take criticism well so I can later reflect and work on them. That being said I often tend to be disorganized and I have difficulty meeting deadlines. This stems from my poor sense of time and my restlessness. These are some things that I hope to improve on soon as these are integral skills to have.</p>
    <h2>Project idea</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>For the longest time my phone has always been scattered with various productivity/focusing apps, to-do listing apps, habit trackers and applications that detect my screentime. Being a person with ADHD, I am always forgetful, disorganized, highly distracted, and have a poor sense of time. They have been things that have always affected my academic and also my personal life. These apps are things that help me gain control of my life even if it’s to a small degree. But I have noticed there are no apps in the market that is specifically targeted towards individuals with ADHD. Sure, there are a lot off apps like I mentioned above, but not one all-encompassing app that had all the features and more and was created specifically with a neurodivergent person in mind. That is exactly what I plan to do with my project this time. Creating an app for people like me that suffer with their daily tasks due to their ADHD.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>Till date, it is known that there are 366.33 million affected adults globally. Furthermore, around 1 in every 20 Australians has ADHD. More than 3 in 4 children diagnosed with ADHD continue to experience the symptoms into adulthood. Most people likely go undiagnosed all their lives according to psychologists. This has made me believe that there is a viable market for this application. Having an elder sibling with a higher spectrum of ADHD also made me realize, even though its something that cannot be cured, their lives can be drastically improved by building consistent habits and having a routine. I want to help people gain control of their own lives again with this application of mine.</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>	<strong>To do listing based on priority:</strong> Before staring the day, we can add a to-do list and after writing all the content, we can select the priority of each task by numbering them on the priority list. For example, if we finish a task that was on top of our list and priority, we get more points than if we finished something at the bottom of the list. The total point being 10. This system of adding points in my opinion would add a sense of achievement for the users instead of just ticking them off the list.</li>
        <li>	<strong>Virtual study rooms:</strong> We can create our own study/ work group or choose to be added to others’ groups. Once we enter the group it will show us all the existing members there and how many hours they worked or studied for that day. The clock restarts each day after 1am for everyone. If someone is studying with us that moment their usernames would glow, and their stopwatch will run. Usernames that are dimmed or not glowing means that person is currently on a break. The people in each group are arranged based on how many hours they worked that day. And as your number on the clock goes up, you are put higher on the panel. Once you start the clock there you can’t access any other apps unless you exit the application entirely, in which case the clockstops running. As people with ADHD and just a lot of people in general have a poor sense of time, this feature would help them be accountable and give them feedback on how much work they did.</li>
        <li>	<strong>Pomodoro timers (25/50):</strong> The application also allows 25 minute and 50-minute pomodoro timer for people that like to work in such time blocks. For the 25-minute timer you get a break for 5 minutes after every 25 minute and a break of 10 minute after every 50 minute block. Then the timer starts again for the beginning unless you stop it form doing so.</li>
        <li>	<strong>Reminders:</strong> The application gives you reminders throughout the day, based on the undone tasks on the to-do list which shows in the notification bar. This will greatly help people with ADHD that are highly forgetful of everything.</li>
        <li>	<strong>White noise:</strong> A feature that allows you to play white noise in the background while using the application. Many people concentrate better when there is some kind of background noise, so I am interested in adding this feature as well. It will supply audios like rain, waves crashing, sound of mountain chimes, or even sounds of burning firewood.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools and technologies required</h3>
    <p>X code IDE is required to build our application using swift. Swift is a programming language we are going to need in order to build the logic of our application. Swift UI is also needed for the UI framework of our program. It makes it easy for us to build the application step by step. Furthermore, we need to be registered with App store in order for us to distribute the application by joining the developer program. When we register for the developer program, we gain access to Test flight for beta testing and for receiving bug reports on our program. Proto or Figma can be used to design the wireframes or mock ups.</p>
    <h3>Skills required</h3>
    <p>For the successful creation of this application, the most important skill required is programming skills. We could also use an app-builder if we do not want to do it from scratch. Another integral skill required is being able to study the market space for maximum exposure of our product. For this we might have to come up with a feasible marketing plan. Lastly, design skills are also required for us to design an application that’s user friendly and to get the basic feel of the application during the creation process. High level of design skills are not required as there are a lot of websites, like I mentioned above, that allow us to do this with ease.</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>My biggest hope to bring with this application is a sense of belonging and community for people. The market might be small as there is a lack of awareness for ADHD and many people that go undiagnosed. But for the most part I believe it would help the users be more organized and gain more control of their lives, be more productive and focus more on the task at hand. Here’s to creating an application that I always wished existed.</p>
    <h2>Ideal job</h2>
    <img src="images/ideal job.jpg">
    <p>I would like to apply for the junior UI/UX designer position at the blue rocks. I have always wanted to work with UX designing as that’s what I have been most inclined to since a long time. I believe I can build on the skills slowly but surely to be a viable candidate for this position. Some of my responsibilities for this position includes joining the Product Team and helping with the product design-related efforts, including user research, prototyping, testing, and iterating on appealing and consistent UX for our products.</p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>For carrying out the above tasks the skills I would need skill sets. I would require:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>	Experience with Figma or adobe experience manager.</li>
        <li>    Experience in interface design and standards, ideally in mobile gaming or digital entertainment.</li>
        <li>	Familiarity with Web 2.0 technologies used for creating online interactive experiences.</li>
        <li>	Up-to-date knowledge of design software like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</li>
        <li>	Good time-management skills.</li>
        <li>	Strong communication and interpersonal skills.</li>
        <li>	A design portfolio</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My current skills</h3>
    <p>From the list I wrote above, the skills that currently hone are for figma but at a beginner level. I believe I must improve a lot and gather more experience using it for the above position. I am still not familiar with adobe illustrator or photoshop which I believe are integral skills required for any design jobs. I do have experience with working at group settings and I like to believe I have good communication skills, but they can always be improved. My design portfolio is still very much barren unfortunately, which I plan to work on throughout my time at university along with my other assessments. By the end of it, I hope to have a strong portfolio that shows my creativity and my keen eye for design.</p>
